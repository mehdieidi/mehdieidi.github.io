Combining the best parts of many other programming languages, Go is fast, scalable, and designed for high-performance networking and multiprocessing. In other words, it’s perfect for network programming.

Network Programming with Go will help you leverage Go to write secure, readable, production-ready network code. In the early chapters, you’ll learn the basics of networking and traffic routing. Then you’ll put that knowledge to use as the book guides you through writing programs that communicate using TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets to ensure reliable data transmission.
