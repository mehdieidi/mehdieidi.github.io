Write software that draws directly on services offered by the Linux kernel and core system libraries. With this comprehensive book, Linux kernel contributor Robert Love provides you with a tutorial on Linux system programming, a reference manual on Linux system calls, and an insider's guide to writing smarter, faster code.

Love clearly distinguishes between POSIX standard functions and special services offered only by Linux. With a new chapter on multithreading, this updated and expanded edition provides an in-depth look at Linux from both a theoretical and applied perspective over a wide range of programming topics, including:

A Linux kernel, C library, and C compiler overview
Basic I/O operations, such as reading from and writing to files
Advanced I/O interfaces, memory mappings, and optimization techniques
The family of system calls for basic process management
Advanced process management, including real-time processes
Thread concepts, multithreaded programming, and Pthreads
File and directory management
Interfaces for allocating memory and optimizing memory access
Basic and advanced signal interfaces, and their role on the system
Clock management, including POSIX clocks and high-resolution timers
