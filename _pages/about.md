I am a masterâ€™s student in Software Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/), with academic interests that span Serverless Computing, Model-Driven Engineering, DevOps, and Method Engineering.

As a member of the [Methodology Engineering Lab](https://www.sharif.ir/en/web/me_ce), I am currently conducting my [thesis](https://www.sharif.ir/en/web/me_ce/w/mehdi-eidi) under the supervision of [Dr. Raman Ramsin](https://sharif.edu/~ramsin/). My research focuses on the engineering of a model-driven methodology for developing serverless software systems, addressing the specific challenges posed by the serverless paradigm.

Alongside my academic work, I have also acquired practical experience in the software industry, where I have been involved in the design and implementation of real-world software systems.
