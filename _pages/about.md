I am a Master’s student in Software Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, with broad academic interests across the spectrum of software engineering—from high-level development methodologies to the detailed technical mechanisms of software development. My work is grounded in a strong emphasis on engineering rigor and software quality, both of which I view as essential pillars of responsible software development.

I am currently conducting my thesis under the supervision of Dr. Raman Ramsin, focusing on the design of a methodology for engineering serverless software systems. This research adopts a situational method engineering approach, aiming to systematically tailor development processes to the specific characteristics and challenges of serverless architectures. The work builds upon concepts from model-driven engineering, software architecture, and serverless computing.

As a member of the Methodology Engineering Lab at SUT, I contribute to ongoing research in areas such as situational method engineering (SME), model-driven development, and serverless computing. My research interests also include safety-critical systems, low-code development, and the broader field of distributed systems.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained practical experience in industry, designing and developing real-world software systems. This dual exposure has shaped my research perspective, enabling me to approach academic challenges with a balanced understanding of both theoretical principles and practical constraints.
